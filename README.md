## 🛠️ Technical Details

This is a static website built with:
- Pure HTML5
- CSS3 with modern features (Grid, Flexbox, Animations)
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks required)
- Responsive design principles

The website acts as a convenient hub that directs users to trusted third-party video download services, as direct video downloading from client-side JavaScript has limitations due to CORS policies and platform restrictions.
